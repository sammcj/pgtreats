NAME 

    pg_log - a set of scripts for reporting errors in postgres logs

SYNOPSIS 

    A set of config, text, and perl script to report errors in postgres logs.


VERSION 

    This document refers to version 0.1 of pg_log, released April 16th,
    2009

PREREQUISITE:

   Installed Perl with MIME::Lite CPAN Module.

USAGE 

    To use pg_log, you need to change the postgresql.conf file to rotate logs 
    everyday and postgres logs naming convention:

        postgresql-YYYY-MM-DD.log

    You can ignore static errors by putting them into static_ignore.dat file, 
    For example:

      canceling statement due to statement timeout 

    You can ignore dyanmic errors by putting them into dynamic_ignore.dat file 
    with ::DYN:: special string, For example:

      syntax error at or near "::DYN::" at character ::DYN::

    Make required adjustments to settings.conf file. Change ip-relays for 
    email from your server and SCRIPT_DIR in pg_log_monitor.pl file.

    Setup postgres cron to send out report everyday. 
    
    We typically setup the cron jobs to look like this:
   
    00 8 * * * /path/bin/perl /home/postgres/bin/pg_log/pg_log_monitor.pl -d
    /data/pgdata/83/pg_log -i -ix -y -c 1>/dev/null

HELP
 
   $/path/to/perl/pg_log_monitor.pl -h    
   Example Usage: pg_log_monitor.pl -d '/data/logs/pg_log' [option] [arg].

   Required Options:
     -d: Accepts an absolute path to the log directory to be analyzed.
   Optional Flags:
   -t: The timespan (in days) to analyze log files within. Default value is 2.
   -i: Static ignore. Ignores static error messages stored in 'static_ignore.dat'.
   -ix: Dynamic ignore. Ignores dynamic error message templates stored in 'dynamic_ignore.dat'.
   -c: Run script in cron mode. Bypasses need for manual entry and e-mails errors to DBA team.
   -y: Start checking from yesterday log file.
   -h: Display help. Generates this message and exits script.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS :

    The package is designed to work on single postgres logs location at a time, if 
    you want to report multiple postgres logs location, you will need to schedule
    seperate cron for each postgres logs loction.
