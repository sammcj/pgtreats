NAME 

    table_growth - a set of scripts for reporting table size growth in postgres

SYNOPSIS 

    A set of schema, functions, and shell script to report table size growth.


VERSION 

    This document refers to version 0.2 of table_growth, released December 9th,
    2008

USAGE 

    To use table_growth, you need to add the schema for holding table size
    information, install the included functions into your database, set up a cron
    job to do the data population, and set up a cron job to send the reports. We
    typically setup the conr jobs to look like this:

    15 0 * * * psql -c "select otools.collect_table_growth(); select
    otools.summarize_table_growth(); " 1>/dev/null 

    45 6 1 * * /var/lib/pgsql/scripts/table_growth_report.sh 1>/dev/null

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS 

    The package is designed to work on single databases at a time, if you want to
    report on multiple databases in a cluster, you will need to install this in
    each individual database, and also set cron jobs independently for each
    database.

    Some actions may not work on older versions of Postgres (before 8.1)
